# Code Wars Challenges
Below are two code challenges borrowed from codewars.com, a site built by developers at a hack-a-thon, that can be very useful in exposing you to varied exercises across many different languages and different techniques for solving them. It provides built-in testing, solutions, and rankings for developers looking to get reps in and "level up". It is a great resource for staying on top of your skills and learning new skills as you grow as a developer.

For the exercises below, follow the link and use the testing suite to validate your code. If you finish the first one with time to spare, move on to the second.
